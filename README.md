# ðŸ“¬ Spamy â€“ SMS Spam Classifier using Naive Bayes

**Spamy** is a beginner-friendly machine learning project that classifies SMS messages as **spam** or **not spam (ham)** using the **Naive Bayes algorithm**.  
This project was built to understand the **complete ML workflow** â€” from raw data to a trained model â€” and to learn how to use the **pandas** library effectively.
